## Setting up connectivity between gaming setup and CN cluster nodes

We want all traffic from lab machines to be routed through the GRE tunnel to cn201 which is bridged with the 10.10.0.0/16 subnet that most cn nodes are located on, e.g., cn115. Basically, we want something like this: client (129.97.60.79) -> GRE tunnel (10.0.0.1 -> 10.0.0.2) -> cn201 (129.97.26.28) -> bridge -> 10.10.0.35 -> cn115-nsm (10.10.0.15)

First, we need to setup a static route for all traffic destined for 10.10.0.0/16 subnet, i.e.,most cn machines to go through the gre tunnel. Here, `10.0.0.2` is the IP of the remote gre tunnel end.

    ip route add 10.10.0.0/16 via 10.0.0.2 dev gre1


Second, we need to setup snat iptables rule on cn201


    sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o brq75fb164e-63 -s 10.0.0.1 -j SNAT --to-source 10.10.0.35


Here, basically the idea is that we take the traffic coming though the gre tunnel destined for 10.10.0.0/16 subnet which exits out the bridged port, and do SNAT to change the source to the bridged interface instead of the tunnel interface. This means that cn nodes have a valid return address.

We also need to make some changes for the UE RLS and RRC commands to work with OpenStack floating IP addresses.

First, we need to send traffic destined for the 192.168.0.0/16 subnet throught the GRE tunnel as well.

    ip route add 10.10.0.0/16 via 10.0.0.2 dev gre1

Next, we need to set a DNAT rule at cn201, which changes the destination of the gNB to the floating IP address of the gNB. This is because the gNB internal address is sent in the RLS messages and cannot be changed.

See the full iptables screenshot at cn201.

# RLS decode error
ueransim in containers is v3.1.3, so use that version in the client as well.


# send game traffic via 5g network
sudo ip route add 129.97.168.30 dev uesimtun0
